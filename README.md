# EMLProject
EmbeddedMachineLearningProject

The Project is to train custom model for keypoint detection in exercises and then classify each exercise. The model is deployed on raspberry Pi board and the output is displayed in real time


Data is collected and prepared using LabelMg. The data is then trained to detect keypoints using the below git Link 

The same data is used to train a classifier different exercises. 

The model evaluation 
# add both the keypoint detection and classifier models 

Results 
# add the evaluation results 

Deployment on raspberry pi board
